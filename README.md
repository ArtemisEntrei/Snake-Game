I was bored and wanted a cool snake game with a few added features. This app allows for off the map travel (there are no walls). I have intregrated two different difficulty levels into the game.

* Reqiurements to run the game *
- Python (3 or later perfered)
- CLI - Command Line interface.
- pygame is required.
 
 * How to run game *
 - Download the source code and run it in the terminal using python.
 - Copy and Paste the source code into a file and running it in terminal (also works)

* Extra Details *
- I used ChatGPT on some of the code as an experiment
- Reach out if you have ideas to implement and I can try them
- Fork away!
