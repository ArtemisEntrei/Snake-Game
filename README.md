I wanted to spice up a classic Snake game with a few unique twists, so I created this version with added features to keep things fun and challenging. One standout feature is the ability to travel off the mapâ€”there are no walls to restrict you! I've also included two difficulty levels to cater to different skill sets. The game tracks your stats and offers rewards based on your performance.

 Requirements to Run the Game:
- Python 3 or later (preferably with pip installed)
- CLI (Command Line Interface)
- Pygame library (Install via pip install pygame)


 How to Run the Game:
- Download the source code and run it through your terminal using Python.
- Alternatively, you can copy and paste the source code into a file and run it in the terminal.


 Extra Details:
- Some of the ideas used were developed with ChatGPT as an experiment.
- Feel free to reach out with ideas! I'd love to explore new features.
- Fork the project and make it your own!
- You can use pyinstaller to turn this game into an executable (.exe) or app for Windows, macOS, Linux, etc. I wanted to keep the code readable and easy to modify.
